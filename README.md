# gogui
Two JAR files for gogui

## History

Gogui is an obsolete project on Sourceforge.  The original author for gogui no longer maintains the project, and
no one has volunteered to maintain the project on Sourceforge.  Remi Coulom has made some enhancements to gogui.

## Reason for this repository

Sourceforge no nonger contains a compiled version of gogui.  Therefore this repository contains two programs from
the Sourceforge project, as JAR files.

gogui.jar

gogui-twogtp.jar

# gogui.jar
