## Learning Go with Leela Zero

Below is my method for studying and improving in the game of Go.

Leela Zero is a Go program written by Gian-Carlo Pascutto, available
on Github.  Mr. Pascutto is well known for his Stockfish program
for chess and for his program for playing Go against a computer,
called Leela.  In 2016, a Google company, called DeepMind, published
a paper about playing Go with neural networks.  DeepMind staged
two matches against 9 Dan professional Go players, where Google's
computer conquered a 9 Dan professional Go master, for the first time
in history.  DeepMind called their Go program Alpha Go.  Later they
created an even stronger program, called Alpha Go Zero.  Alpha Go Zero
taught itself to play Go with no human input, by simply following the
rules of Go.

Gian-Carlo Pascutto used the DeepMind paper on Alpha Go Zero to
duplicate the logic of the program, as much as possible.  He
called his new program Leela Zero.

Any amateur Go player outside of China, Japan, and Korea, can learn
to play Go by simply playing against Leela Zero at different
levels of weights files.  By playing one game of Go per day, or 7
games of Go per week, an amateur Go player can improve by a level
of one stone every year or so.  Improvement is usually very rapid
at the beginning, and then tapers off to steady, but slower,
improvement.  Having a Go teacher is not essential to improvement
in Go, because Leela Zero shows the amateur player where the best
move is, all throughout a match.

Leela Zero has 287 neural networks at different levels of strength.
The neural networks are labeled LZ000 through LZ287.  These are called
weights files.  See the link below for the website, where you can
download some, or all, of the weights files.  It is better for you
to download as many weights files as possible, in case they no longer
become available.

In general, weights file LZ125 is professional strength.  LZ287 is
super human strength, with the exception of certain ladders or
semeai fights involving large groups, called dragons.

One way to use Leela Zero to improve is to play with the same weights
file for two months, and then move up to the next weights file in
sequence.  A strong amateur player may play at the strength of
WT061.  At 6 weights files per year, it could take 10 years for
a go player to reach that strength at this pace.

Whenever you play against Leela Zero, you can save your game record.
If you show your game record to a stronger player, you can get tips
on how to improve.  You can also play your game record against WT287,
the highest weights file.  Leela Zero will suggest where you should
have played.
